							<h2>What are teacher recommendations?</h2>
							<p>
								Part of the college application process requires that you receive teacher recommendations.
								These are letters written by your teachers that speak to your personality, academic excellence, and performance in a classroom setting.
								These are essential to showing colleges the kind of person you are apart from your academic transcript and curricular portfolio.
								Be sure to remember you will likely not be allowed to read teacher recommendation letters that are written for you.
								This is because students typically waive their right to view their teacher recommendations for better reliability.
								You will be given a choice between waving your rights and not waving your rights, though it is often recommended to trust your teachers and give them privacy by giving up your ability to read the letters after they are submitted.
								Colleges will see if you do not waive your rights, so keep that in mind.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="which_teach" class="anchor">
							<h2>Which teachers should I ask?</h2>
							<p>
								It’s recommended that you ask no more than 2 teachers for recommendation letters. These teachers should come from 2 different core subjects—not necessarily non-core electives—so colleges can view your strengths in multiple fields.
								It is perfectly acceptable to get two humanities recommendations or two STEM recommendations, though avoid two recommendations from the same subject (i.e. two math recommendations).
								Your recommendation letter should be made by teachers that you have a strong bond with, such as through your daily participation in their classes, and strong grades.
								Although it is advised to pick teachers from your Junior year, picking Sophomore year teachers is also completely okay! It is not conventional to ask Freshman year teachers. If you think you had a good relationship with your teacher, and had a good grade in the class, don’t be afraid to ask for a recommendation!
							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="how_should" class="anchor">
							<h2>How should I ask for my recommendation?</h2>
							<p>
								This depends on your teachers! Some teachers have grade requirements for their teacher recommendations, some teachers have certain ways they’d like to be asked, etc.
								The most important thing to remember after you’ve chosen teachers of interest is to stay in close communication with them. Go to office hours! Stay alert for announcements!
							</p>
							<p>
								If your teacher’s preferred method of being asked for a recommendation is through email, we’re here to help! Here’s some advice:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Ask early!</strong>
									Now’s a great time to bring up recommendations to your teachers in office hours (if they haven’t already spoken about it).
									You don’t want to ask too late and have missed your chance!
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Respect your teachers!</strong>
									Even if your teachers follow an unconventional method for teacher recommendations, be sure to listen and respect their choices.
									Remember, you need them -- not the other way around.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Stay formal!</strong>
									No matter how casually you converse with your teacher during office hours/class, it is important to ask them for a letter of recommendation formally.
									You are asking them a favor as their student, not their friend!
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Here is a sample email!
							</p>
							<em>
								Dear Ms. Smith,
								<br><br>
								I hope all is well!
								My name is [ ], and I am a student in your 11th period Art class.
								Throughout the year, I’ve been enjoying your class and the way I’ve been able to perform as a student in it.
								One particular moment that stands out to me is when we were completing our watercolor paintings, and I was able to learn how to create new colors with the palettes we were given.
								I’ve been able to express my creativity and diligence in your class. In addition, I feel as though I’ve been able to share the kind of person I am with you, as the teacher-student relationship we developed is very important to me.
								Would you be willing to write a college letter of recommendation for me? I value both your time and your class, and I would appreciate it very much.
								Thank you, and have a wonderful day!
								<br><br>
								Best,<br>
								[ ]

							</em>

						</div>

						<div id="when_should" class="anchor">
							<h2>When should I ask for my recommendation?</h2>
							<p>
								Do not feel pressured to ask your teachers for recommendations right now!
								Many of the teachers—if they have not already done so—will reach out to you to share their protocols on requesting recommendation letters.
								Generally, students ask for recommendations late into the second semester and a few teachers will not accept requests until the school year is over.
								Feel free to ask your teachers when an appropriate time to ask would be or wait for them to make an announcement.
								Again, you do not need to ask your teachers right now. If you want to get on top of your recommendations, the spring is an apt time to ask.
								Just do not wait until late fall, or you might not get one in time.
							</p>

						</div>

						<div id="what_supp" class="anchor">
							<h2>What are supplemental recommendation letters?</h2>
							<p>
								If you have worked with adults outside of a specific Stuyvesant class, consider getting a supplemental recommendation letter from them.
								Requesting supplemental letters works in a similar way to teacher recommendation and can be an additional asset to your application.
							</p>
							<p>Adults that might be appropriate to ask for supplemental recommendations from are:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>People that you interned under</li>
								<li>Faculty advisors from Stuyvesant clubs or outside organizations</li>
								<li>Employers or coaches</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Supplemental recommendations are by no means required or expected, so do not feel any pressure to have them. </p>
						</div>

						<div id="what_if" class="anchor">
						<h2>What if I do not think I have any teachers to ask for recommendations?</h2>
							<p>
								Whether you were unable to maintain a relationship with your teachers in a remote setting or you are not satisfied with your academic performance in a given class, there is still time in the second semester to show improvement.
								Additionally, you do not need to receive an 100 in a class to be eligible for a recommendation.
								Many students have received conventionally “low” grades and have still been fine come recommendation time.
								Just make sure to go the extra mile and participate.
								If you do not think you can, teachers understand that this year has been hard on everyone and communicate that to them when requesting a letter.
								Also, your recommendation letters will not make or break your application; you have your extracurriculars, transcript, and personal essays to convey your abilities as a student.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div id="advice" class="anchor">
						<h2>Class of ‘21’s Advice</h2>
						<p>
							We asked the Class of 2021 what their experience was like asking for recommendations this past year…
							Here are some of their responses to a series of questions we posed!
						</p>

						<h3>Is there any specific “etiquette” you would recommend to follow when writing to teachers?</h3>

						<div class="responses">
							<p>
								I didn’t have to ask since my teachers chose the students they’d write recs for, but I have helped my friends do so.
								If you have a personal connection with the teacher, you should definitely expand on that.
								Even if it sounds cringy, explaining how their class made an impact on you would help your chances.
								If you don’t have a connection with a teacher but you still would like them to write your rec, you should still describe how/why you appreciated that class to explain why you chose them, although keep it small so that it doesn’t sound like kissing up.
							</p>

							<p>
								<ol style="padding-left: 1em">
									<li>
										Email them about the rec, providing enough info abt what you’re applying for & the deadline for the rec (you should give them at least one week).
									</li>
									<li>
										Ask in class abt the rec and confirm whether the teacher can do it.
									</li>
									<li>
										Send reminder emails the week before & 2-3 days before the rec is due.
									</li>
									<li>
										Always be polite! Saying thank you a lot helps.
									</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<p>
								Make it specific (why you want them to write your rec, how you have grown in their class, why you think they would be able to write a good rec for you) and be aware of the amount of time/effort that a teacher puts into their rec.
							</p>

							<p>
								Be respectful and kind.
								Teachers don’t owe you a recommendation.
								Ask in May so that you have enough time to give your teacher information if they ask for it and so your teacher has enough time to write it.
								SPECIFY IF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OF APPLYING EARLY.
							</p>

							<p>
								It's nice to mention why you decided to ask them to write a rec.
								Maybe you've really enjoyed the class, or maybe you had a conversation with the teacher that really impacted you; whatever the reason, talk about it!
								Also, you're asking them for a favor, so be polite and don't assume they're answer is yes no matter how well you do in the class.
							</p>

							<p>
								Write as early as possible, but make sure it's within a reasonable timeframe.
								May is probably the best month to ask; don't ask too early like in March or April or too late like late June.
								Make sure you check if your teachers have specific guidelines such as required rec material; if not, ask in an email and give a brief explanation why you chose them.
							</p>

							<p>
								Be polite! Let them know how much you enjoyed their class, the connection you've made with them, how you've grown as a student to explain why you think they would be a good recommender
							</p>

							<p>
								Etiquette wise - Of course be nice and respectful, but most of all try not to pester your teachers or be too needy. They have a lot going on as well. Also understand ur not entitled to a rec, this is a big favor essentially. Know that whoever you're asking a rec for, there are many other kids asking as well, and that's lots of emails, and can be a lot of recs to eventually write. Make sure to also read your teacher’s syllabus or website and many teachers outline their policies.
							</p>

							<p>
								When asking over email, there isn’t a particular script to follow, although it could be a good idea to first ask to speak during office hours, and then ask your teacher aloud.
								If you prefer to ask in writing, your email should be polite and professional, and you should be sure to make a case for why that teacher should write your recommendation.
								Show passion for the subject or class, and briefly reflect on the work you’ve done in the class, including how you may have struggled or improved over time.
								Especially when asking a teacher in a subject that you’re interested in studying in college, be sure to mention your interest in that subject, including how their class may have inspired you to pursue that subject further.
							</p>

							<h3>How did you pick which teachers to ask for recommendations?</h3>

							<p>
								I picked the teachers whose classes I enjoyed the most and felt I connected with best.
								I also took into consideration how I knew them outside of class and what subjects they taught in terms of having a balanced picture of me as a student.
							</p>

							<p>
								I chose teachers that I thought best knew me/my personality and whose classes I did well on and participated in.
								They were also the classes I was most interested in and enjoyed.
							</p>

							<p>
								I asked if a teacher knew me not just as a student but also as a person.
								The second teacher I asked didn't know me as well, but I put a lot of effort into their class.
							</p>

							<p>
								One of my teachers I had for both sophomore and junior year so asking him was a no-brainer since he got to know me and saw me grow over the course of two years.
								My other teacher for the year was my science area teacher (physics).
								Though I intend to pursue chemistry, I think my physics teacher would have written a better recommendation for me as I struggled in his class but ultimately was successful.
							</p>

							<p>
								I picked teachers who I had personal connections with and who knew me beyond classes. They would know things like how I like baking egg tarts.
							</p>

							<p>
								I made my decision based on quality and efficiency.
								I’m the type to get nervous when deadlines come near so I wanted to make sure my teachers submit them right on time.
								This helped me make my decision for my STEM rec; I ended up choosing the teacher who didn’t know me as well (although that wasn’t an issue since they made me answer a survey) but submitted things quickly over the one who knew me better but did things last minute.
								For my humanities rec, I chose the teacher who knew me better. All my options wrote good recs, fortunately, so the decision wasn’t that difficult to make.
							</p>

							<p>
								I picked teachers whose classes I really enjoyed, and felt had gotten to really know me well over the year.
								They're teachers who I'm comfortable saying hi to in the hallways and having a conversation with during a free.
								Worry less about their "clout" as a teacher, the best recs are from teachers who know you the best.
								Even if you struggled a bit in the class, if you were trying and putting in the work, they see that.
								And if you improved drastically in the class as the year went on, even better.
							</p>

							<p>
								I chose two teachers that would be able to speak to two sides of me as a student: one teacher whose class I did well in, and one whose class I struggled in.
								The former teacher was my Sophomore year English teacher, who I had built a strong relationship with, long before Covid, and who was again my English teacher as a Senior.
								They had seen me ‘in my element’ in one of my stronger subjects.
								The latter teacher was my Junior Fall Precalc teacher, who gave me a lower grade than I received in English, but who saw me work hard to try and improve in the class.
								I’m not planning on studying a STEM subject in college, but having a recommendation from a teacher in a weaker subject of mine was helpful as a character reference, showing admissions officers the kind of student I am when faced with a challenge.
								It turned out that I asked one humanities teacher and one STEM teacher, but that is not at all necessary. As long as your teachers are from different departments, you will be fine.
							</p>

							<p>
								I just thought of the classes I enjoyed and the teachers I knew most.
								I ended up picking Mr. Nieves and Monsieur Ramirez for my two.
								I thought those were my best options, especially since I’ve had Mr. Nieves for both my freshman and junior year, while I had Monsieur Ramirez from sophomore year all the way to today.
								Those were the two classes that I always looked forward to — as well as the classes I felt I grew the most from.
							</p>

							<h3>How was your recommendation-asking process affected by remote learning?</h3>

							<p>Oh god it’s horrible. It’s so much harder to get close to my teachers...I can only participate in class and go to their office hours.</p>

							<p>
								I had to ask over email instead of in person.
								Luckily I knew my teachers pretty well by the time remote learning started, so that wasn't really an issue for me.
							</p>

							<p>I had to ask via email instead of in-person, but it wasn't significantly affected by remote learning.</p>

							<p>
								I didn’t have to ask for recs because the two teachers I went with offered them to me midway into the semester.
								However, I did have an issue where one of my emails was sent to my teacher’s spam.
								They took offense to my supposed lack of response and sent out a rather passive-aggressive email, but I just emailed them with evidence and apologized so it worked out.
							</p>

							<p>
								It wasn’t in person and had to be done over email/google form.
								With one of my teachers I had a Zoom call to talk a little about myself and with the other, I filled out a google form with information.
							</p>

							<p> Not much has changed with the process itself, but the personal aspect of it has definitely been taken away.</p>

							<p>
								Honestly not much, obviously asking for a rec and receiving it is easy to do remote.
								I was lucky to feel close to the teachers I asked, and didn't need that time I lost second semester to "get to know them better" or develop a stronger relationship with them.
							</p>

							<p>
								When remote learning began, I had asked for one of my recommendations, but not the other.
								I emailed that teacher with my request for a recommendation at the start of April, and they replied to me within a week, but remote learning wasn’t a major obstacle to the process.
							</p>

							<p>
								With remote learning, I didn’t have to ask my teachers in-person (which I’m actually pretty thankful for).
								I know I eventually would have had to do it if COVID didn’t exist, but if I were to get rejected in person, I would be so embarrassed!
								At least with emails, everything feels more smooth and you don’t really have to practice your reaction when you’re denied. Some teachers also have specific protocol for when to ask.
								For example, Monsieur Ramirez will only write it if you take AP French and you reach out on the first day of senior year.
							</p>

							<h3>What advice would you give yourself from one year ago regarding teacher recommendations?</h3>

							<p>
								Don’t be afraid to look at sophomore year teachers for options!
								I had a really good connection with one of my sophomore year teachers but only considered them as a backup, even though they would have been a really good choice.
								For people who do choose this though, I would recommend asking early, especially if they are also a junior year teacher since they will run out of spots quickly.
							</p>

							<p>Be active in seeking out recs and getting close to teachers!</p>

							<p>Spend more time on the responses to their questions (most teachers will give you a list of things they want from you if they are writing you a rec). </p>

							<p>Participate in classes and try to connect with teachers. Do some outside reading or research for the class and show initiative. </p>

							<p>
								Don't stress so much!
								I was so anxious about asking for recs which I now realize is ridiculous.
								Teachers do this every year for so many students.
								They are not going to be mean or scary about it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Submit your materials in a timely manner!
								I submitted mine rather late to a teacher and they were unsure if they would have time to write my rec, but fortunately they were able to.
							</p>

							<p>
								Your teacher recommendations will turn out fine!
								Don't underestimate how well teachers actually know you—they've seen you work and interact with others in and out of class.
							</p>

							<p>Just be patient, and if you don't know your teachers policy for recs, you can email them asking what their policy is, without directly asking them to write a rec which can come off a bit needy.</p>

							<p>
								When it comes to college recommendations, teachers may have specific criteria about who they agree to write for, or they may cap after a certain number of students.
								Make sure you have multiple teachers in mind, in case one of them isn’t able to write for you.
							</p>

							<p>
								Teachers often ask you to prepare some extra information that they can use to get to know more about you and write up a better rec.
								A lot of the questions they ask often echo your academic interests and they’ll exhibit some of the qualities that your entire application will show.
								I did put a lot of thought into these, but thinking back today, I should have thought more about what I wanted to do in life — the big picture.
								There’s a path I would have added if I had the chance to fill it out all again, but I suppose it’s fine.
								I should’ve really sat down and thought past college while putting it all down on paper.
							</p>

							<h3>Biggest tip for juniors seeking recommendations?</h3>

							<p>
								Take other people's recommendations for who to pick as a recommender with a huge, huge grain of salt.
								Every relationship is different, and your connection and experience with a teacher will be very different from those of another person. Also, no student can actually read their recommendations, so our knowledge is very limited.
								Go with your gut and pick people who know you best and can speak about you from different angles.
							</p>

							<p>
								Don't stress over how long it takes teachers to respond!
								They're people too; they're not going to give automatic responses.
								If they don't respond after at least two days, send a followup email.
								Chances are that they either hadn't seen it or had been too busy to respond. You're definitely going to find someone!
							</p>

							<p>
								Try your best to make a connection with your teachers.
								It's especially hard now that we're online, but you can still show up to office hours or shoot them an email about something interesting you saw/read that they might appreciate.
								Even just participating a lot will help set you apart.
							</p>

							<p>Don't base who you ask for recs on whether they are known to write good recs, pick the teachers who you think know you the best. </p>

							<p>
								Go to teacher office hours - even if you don’t need help, just chatting with them is nice!
								Some Stuy teachers may not be the best teachers, but they’re really great people.
							</p>

							<p>
								It’s hard but try not to stress out!
								As long as you get a rec by the end of the semester, you’ll be fine.
								I even had some friends get it over the summer / early fall.
								Also, only ask two teachers (unless you are rejected or need a 3rd rec for a special program).
								It’s awkward having to reject a teacher who said yes because the one you really wanted agreed to write your rec.
							</p>

							<p>
								Pick teachers you like and just be considerate.
								These teachers will write a bunch of recs, and also have to respond to all emails from students asking for recs- you're not the only one asking.
							</p>

							<p>
								I’ve heard a lot of people say stuff like “you need one humanity and one stem rec to get into college” or a “language rec doesn’t weigh as much as a math rec.”
								The subject truly does not matter and one should choose the teacher that they feel can paint the best, most candid picture of you.
								Also, don’t ask too late but also don’t rush to ask a teacher too quickly where you’d eventually think there’s one better month after.
							</p>

							<h3>Any additional comments?</h3>

							<p>
								Consider supplemental recs! If you’re on a sports team/club board, ask your coach/faculty advisor.
								You’ll still need 2 main recs but these are helpful, especially if your stats aren’t necessarily the best.
